# HybriDroid

This project presents a hybrid approach, called HybriDroid, for automatic detecting data leakage vulnerabilities within a bundle of apps, allowing the end-users to check the apps installed on their device for data leakage vulnerabilities. It combines static- and dynamic-analysis methods to overcome the code coverage, dynamic feature, and scalability challenges in detecting. The evaluation results show  that HybriDroid is effective in analyzing the data leakage vulnerability both inter- and intra-component communication. It achieves a high precision in DroidBench 3.0 test suite.
